Rust is system language, which means it is a low level programming language.

Rust provides a package manager tool by default and built system, that's cargo.

Package manager tool is a useful tool to ease development by providing several key functions:
1. Project initialization with "cargo new"
2. Dependency management in Cargo.toml also you can use "cargo add/remove"
3. Build and Compile with "cargo build"
4. Unit tests in the tests directory
5. Distribution and Publishing with "cargo publish"
6. Generate documentation automatically with "cargo doc"


You can use Cargo to compile your rust application code, then rust will generate a binary file that can be run on the appropriate target system. Cargo will only compile files that changed since the previous compilation, saving time and resources.
